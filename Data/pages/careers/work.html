    As one of the founders, I have been there from day 1 and have had the chance to see the project through from the start to the end. This has taught me alot about the different stages of game development, from the early stages (pre-production, prototyping, market research) all the way to polishing, bug fixing, and releasing the game.

    While I mostly focused on programming (mixture of C++ & blueprints), I've also had to wear many other hats. I was doing cinematics & animations, story writing, designing levels and gameplay (including working on the game design document) and ALOT of management. I had to manage other programmers in the team, voice actors we hired, and different artists/animators we were outsourcing to.

    Worked on algorithms which performed real-time motion detection in both new and existing security systems. 
    <br><br>
    D uring this time I was also able to gain experience in working with Qt, OpenCV, and C++, as I was required to integrate my solutions into client's Qt based applications. -->
